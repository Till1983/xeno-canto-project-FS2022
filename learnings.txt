Key Learnings

1. After the past week's project consulation session, I was forced to admit that I had analyzed the dataset for Germany
without having a clear idea what question I wanted to answer. It is very easy to be mesmerised by the power that the
data visualisation toolkit brings, but all this power is worth very little if it is used aimlessly. Looking at a single country
does not make much sense if one wants to gain insight into broader migration patterns of birds. That why I have decided to pick out
a number of bird species' migration patterns to analyse.

2. I have become more comfortable with pandas and the data visualisation tools for Python and appreciate the need for fluency in the tools
of data science. As an amateur user of R and the Tidyverse, I felt much less comfortable with Python and its data science tools, but I
recognise that Python does have the advantage of being an all-purpose language while R, simple and powerful as it, has the contraint of
belonging to the statistics and data visualisation domain. R's simplicity made me more comfortable with it as a tool, but it is necessary 
to leave that comfort zone and maintain data science "multilingualism", for lack of a better term.
