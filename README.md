# xeno-canto-project-FS2022

In this project I will investigate the migration and breeding patterns of several bird species. The metadata haven been taken from https://xeno-canto.org, 
which allows bird and other wildlide sounds to be uploaded and analysed. The metadata were downloaded using the xeno-canto API-wrapper (https://pypi.org/project/xeno-canto/). The analysis starts with Germany and then proceeds to specific birds.
The metadata for Germany will be analysed for some of the most common bird species, for example: the Common Blackbird. The species will then themselves
be anaylsed for their migration and breeding behaviour.

The import and normalisation and the analysis of data will be kept in seperate jupyter notebooks to ensure legibility of the code and to prevent
files from growing to big.
