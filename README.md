# xeno-canto-project-FS2022

In this project I will investigate the migration and breeding patterns of several bird species. The metadata haven been taken from https://xeno-canto.org, 
which allows bird and other wildlide sounds to be uploaded and analysed. The metadata were downloaded using the xeno-canto API-wrapper (https://pypi.org/project/xeno-canto/). The analysis starts with Germany and then proceeds to a specific bird: the Common Blackbird. The species will then itself be anaylsed for its migration and breeding behaviour.

The import and normalisation and the analysis of data will be kept in seperate jupyter notebooks to ensure legibility of the code and to prevent
files from growing to big. Exploratory data analysis and more detailed analysis will also be kept in seperate notebooks as the project progresses.
